In `app.sql`, write the statements to:

* Create a table, `owners`
* Create a related table, `bicycles`
* Create 3 bicycles and 2 owners
* Update the properties of one of the bicycles
* List all the bicycles
* List all the bicycles with their owners
* Delete one of the bicycles

Run `app.sql` against a `sqlite3` database to ensure it works!
